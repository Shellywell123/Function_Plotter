# Function Plotter
Will plot functions from direct input, written in Python3 for linux terminal
Uses matplotlib and numpy libraries.

## Usage
 - for 2d functions execute run2d.py
 - for 3d functions execute run3d.py

## Features
 - supports 2D and 3D functions
 - supports trigonometry functions
 - supports multiple input forms:
    - y = f(x,z), y = f(x), y = f(z)
    - x = f(y,z), x = f(y), x = f(z)
    - z = f(x,y), z = f(x), z = f(y)
 - user inputted lims (2d only supported thus far)

## Fixes to be made
- some features break after one false input

## Examples

- 'z = x*sin(y)**2'
